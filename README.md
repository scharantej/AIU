## Flask Application Design

### Overview
To introduce high school students to artificial intelligence (AI) and its applications in various fields, we propose an interactive Flask web application that will:

- Explain the basics of AI, including its history, key concepts, and different types of AI.
- Discuss the applications of AI across different domains like healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment.
- Address the ethical and societal implications of AI, encouraging students to think critically about the role of AI in society.

This culturally relevant app will be designed to engage students of diverse backgrounds with interactive quizzes, real-world examples, and opportunities to create their own AI projects. The user-friendly interface, progress tracking, and gamification elements will keep students motivated and engaged throughout their learning journey.

### HTML Files
1. **index.html:** This file will serve as the homepage of the application. It will provide an overview of the app, introduce the concept of AI, and guide users to explore different sections of the app.


2. **ai_basics.html:** This file will delve into the fundamentals of AI, explaining its history, key concepts, and various types of AI. It will use engaging visuals and interactive elements to make the learning process interactive.


3. **ai_applications.html:** This file will showcase real-world examples of AI applications across different fields such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and entertainment. It will highlight the benefits and potential of AI in these domains.


4. **ai_ethics.html:** This file will address the ethical and societal implications of AI. It will discuss topics like bias, privacy, job loss, and the potential impact of AI on humanity's future.


5. **ai_projects.html:** This file will provide opportunities for students to create their own AI projects. It will include resources, tutorials, and guidance on developing AI-powered applications.


6. **assessment.html:** This file will host interactive quizzes and exercises to reinforce learning and assess students' understanding of AI concepts and applications.


7. **progress_tracker.html:** This file will serve as a central hub for users to track their progress through the app. It will display completed modules, quizzes, and achievements, and encourage users to continue learning.

### Routes
1. **@app.route('/')**: This route will handle the homepage of the application and display the content of the **index.html** file.


2. **@app.route('/ai_basics')**: This route will display the **ai_basics.html** file, presenting the fundamentals of AI to users.


3. **@app.route('/ai_applications')**: This route will render the **ai_applications.html** file, showcasing real-world examples of AI applications across various fields.


4. **@app.route('/ai_ethics')**: This route will display the content of the **ai_ethics.html** file, addressing the ethical and societal implications of AI.


5. **@app.route('/ai_projects')**: This route will handle the **ai_projects.html** file, providing students with resources and guidance for creating their own AI projects.


6. **@app.route('/assessment')**: This route will display the interactive quizzes and exercises from the **assessment.html** file, allowing users to test their understanding of AI concepts and applications.


7. **@app.route('/progress_tracker')**: This route will render the **progress_tracker.html** file, displaying users' progress through the app, completed modules, and achievements.


8. **@app.route('/submit_project')**: This route will handle the submission of AI projects created by students, allowing them to share their work with the community.


9. **@app.route('/get_leaderboard')**: This route will provide a leaderboard displaying the top-performing students in the app's quizzes and challenges.

We believe this Flask application design effectively addresses the problem statement, offering an engaging and interactive learning experience for high school students to explore the fascinating world of AI.
